gene_annotation_search.py â€” Command-Line Tool for Querying Gene Annotations

Author: Adhithi R. Raghavan

Description:
This script allows users to search for specific keywords in gene annotations
stored in a local SQLite database (`arabidopsis.sqlite`). Results are returned
as a formatted table using pandas.

Usage:
    python gene_annotation_search.py -q kinase

Dependencies:
    - pandas
    - sqlite3
    - argparse

   #Select *: All columns,
   #From the table  with name  geneannotation table, 
   #Where column name is annotation, 
   # Need wild card search for string or name 
   #Using % - the stuff ahead or behind the string, I don't know, but find anything with it . Can have any string of zero or more characters before or after.
    #Like - not definitive, but may have something like the string with anything behind or in front of it.
    #.format(word = word): Assign word in the {} statement

    #This is to add flags, add as many as you want.
